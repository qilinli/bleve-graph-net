# BLEVE Graph Network (BGN)

This repository contains PyTorch implementations of BGN from the following paper:

    Li, Qilin, Zitong Wang, Ling Li, Hong Hao, Wensu Chen, and Yanda Shao. 
    "Machine learning prediction of structural dynamic responses using graph neural networks." 
    Computers & Structures 289 (2023): 107188.

The code is significantly based on [this reporsitory](https://github.com/echowve/meshGraphNets_pytorch).
